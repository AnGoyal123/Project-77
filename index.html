                Visual Studio is an offline IDE app which is a more advanced version of the app brackets. 
                It will help me in coding a more advanced app using the languages html, css and JavaScript.
                In setting up this app you have to go to the website and click on download for whichever software I have like window or mac etc.
                Then I have to double click on the downloaded file and agree to some terms.
                I have to then install and when its done it will open on its own. 
                Then we have to download an eatra thing "Live server"in the visual studio. 
                Thats all after that you can create a folder and then html and other files to code in.

                The console screen is used to interact with the user 
                and you can open it by right clicking on the screen.
                Then go to inspect thing at the bottom.
                After that a page will open on the side there are options on the top of it.
                The second option says Console on it.We have to click that to reach the console screen.
                Now to print things on there we have to use the function "console.log()" and whatever we want to print we can write it.
                If we want to write a text e will have to put double quotes.

           var text = "My first console Project";
           console.log(text);

           var firstName = "Anshuman ";
           console.log(firstName);

           var lastName = "Goyal"
           console.log(lastName);

           var fullName = firstName.concat(lastName);
           console.log(fullName);

           var n1 = 4;
           var n2 = 2;

           console.log(n1 + n2);
           console.log(n1 - n2);
           console.log(n1 * n2);
           console.log(n1 / n2);
        </script>
